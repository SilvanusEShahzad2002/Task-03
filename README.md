# Multiplication Tables in C

This program prints the **multiplication tables from 1 to 5**.
It uses a **nested for loop**: the outer loop runs numbers from 1 to 5, and the inner loop multiplies each of those numbers by values from 1 to 10. After each table, a blank line is printed for better readability.

### How to Run

1. Save the code as `tables.c`
2. Compile the program:

   ```bash
   gcc tables.c -o tables
   ```
3. Run the program:

   ```bash
   ./tables
   ```

### Example Output

```
1 x 1 = 1
1 x 2 = 2
...
1 x 10 = 10

2 x 1 = 2
2 x 2 = 4
...
2 x 10 = 20

...
5 x 10 = 50
